# raspberry-pi-usb-midi-host
A project to turn the Raspberry Pi into a USB Midi Host

I'd seen others do the same thing in Ruby and using Python to control the LCD Display. I would have preferred everything in python so that's what this is about. Feel free to contribute in any way you like. I'll add instructions in the future, but in a nutshell add connectall.py as a midi service on the raspberry pi to be run at boot. Works a charm for me.
